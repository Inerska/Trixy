# Overview
Trixy is a discord bot made with â™¥ powered with [Remora.Discord ðŸ¦ˆ](https://github.com/Nihlus/Remora.Discord) by Nihlus. The bot is free for everyone, and mostly open-source, we encourage everyone to make pull request and contribute to the project. The goal of the project is to make a discord bot with a pretty good project structure and a clean source code (if you see something that can be improve, do not hesitate to contribute). It's an all-in-one bot, we want Trixy to contain the most features it can, moderation, social, administration tasks, etc. 

# Installation
To install Trixy within your discord server
* You can invite Trixy with the <a href="#invite">invite link</a>.
* You can self-host the discord bot, if so, please continue.

Made with a generic worker hoster, probably everybody can self-host Trixy easily, just assure to create a `Properties` directory inside `Trixy.BotWorker` and create a `launchSettings.json` file, and please follow this default pattern file :
```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "Trixy.BotWorker": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "NSFW_ANIME_API_BASE_URL_": "https://api.waifu.pics/nsfw/",
        "SFW_ANIME_API_BASE_URL_": "https:/api.waifu.pics/sfw/",
        "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "TRIXY_": "your_bot_token_here",
        "CONNECTION_STRING_": "your_sqlite_connection_string_here"
      },
      "dotnetRunMessages": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

Then configure the `Trixy.BotWorker/appsettings.Development.json` file, make sure that `Trixy.BotWorker` is the startup-project before you launch, and Trixy can be operational !
